The user interface for an Android app is built using a hierarchy of layouts (ViewGroup objects) and widgets (View objects). 

We can declare a layout in two ways:
1.Declare UI elements in XML. Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the View classes and subclasses, such as those for widgets and layouts.
2.Instantiate layout elements at runtime. Your application can create View and ViewGroup objects (and manipulate their properties) programmatically.

Each layout file(here xml file) must contain exactly one root element, which must be a View or ViewGroup object
When you compile your application, each XML layout file is compiled into a View resource.

Button, textview etc are View objects

 You can add views either from code
 Once you have created a tree of views, there are typically a few types of common operations you may wish to perform:
 1.set properties
 2.set focus
 3.set up listeners
 4.set visibility
